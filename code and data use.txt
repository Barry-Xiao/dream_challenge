Codes and data use for dream challenge in github:

1. You should download a copy of training data and put it in your local `data` folder in github in order to run codes to reshape and clean the data.

The path should be 'data/training_data_2022-07-21'


2. data explanation:
	2.1'data/metadata_imputed.csv': 
		The imputed metadata. The code for this should be in dropbox
	2.2'data/combo_clean_data.csv': 
		This combined metadata, CST, alpha diversity and Lactobacillus relative abundance. This dataset did some operations to those who have repeated measured in one week. (For those whose repeated measurements had the same CST, their alpha diversitys and Lactobacillus relative abundances for that week were averaged as one record for that week. For those not, all the records were removed.) The codes for generating this data was 'dream_data_collect'
	2.3 Files looked like 'data/phylo_.1_preterm.csv' were generated by 'feature_filtering.R':
		They were features of different levels of phylotypes/taxonomy selected by Aldex2 based on preterm/early_preterm outcome

3. code explanation:
	3.1: 'data_generator.R': This should be run with shell/command line with arguments. The input arguments are:
		outcome:was_preterm/was_early_preterm
		data_path: path to the phylo/tax data
		filter_path: path to the filter file(2.3)
		outfile_path: path to output file
	The output will be a file combining metadata, CST, alpha diversity and the phylo/tax you specified with only features selected based on the filter. For repeated measurements within a week, the same strategy were taken as 2.2

	3.2 'data_generator_no_filter.R': This should be run with shell/command line with arguments. The input arguments are:
		outcome:was_preterm/was_early_preterm
		data_path: path to the phylo/tax data
		meta_path: path to output meta
		profile_path: path to output phylo/tax
	The output will be two files. One is identical to combo_data_clean except it didn't include the relative abundance of Lactobacillus. The other is the processed phylo/tax data matrix without filtering.(No header or row index. This is the input for DeepMicro package.)


Sorry about the messy naming and for-my-own-use coding style. If you have any questions, please let me know. If you want to customize based on your need, please do that locally, thanks!
