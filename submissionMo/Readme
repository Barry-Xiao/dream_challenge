Basically, you run R code in your local computer to selected feature. What you need to store is only the model from python. There is no need to upload files like "metadataimputed". Also, you need to output the features, which is the covariates in each data set that you selected, i.e. for phylotypes data, you may want to have a file stores all the names like "pt0001", etc.
